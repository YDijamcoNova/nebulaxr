*MONDAY 6/22*

*BACK-END*
** DONE: Presented systems demo to Joe and team
** DONE: Cleaned up project systems files and got rid of unused files
** DONE: Deleted lines of unused C++ code from the engine and nodes from blueprints
** DONE: Universalized interaction by switching from button interaction to interface interaction


*TUESDAY 6/23*

*BACK-END*
** DONE: Ported NYE systems from third person in the demo to first person
** DONE: Debugged object outline system issue where functionality in VR was broken
** DONE: Created a component that can be attached to any static mesh to responsively hover with consideration of distance to ground and impulse
** DONE: Merged fragmented Nova assets when porting from Blender

*WEDNESDAY 6/24*

*FRONT-END*
** DONE: Created and formatted new project file in the Unreal Engine 4
** DONE: Set the project in the FIRST-PERSON Template map as editor startup map, "NYELobbyExperience"
** DONE: Verified the desired C++ Visual Scripts and starter content was enabled for the project
** DONE: Eliminated template's pre-existing architecture -- PLEASE DO NOT alter post-process volume or lightmass volume; removing it distrubs lighting of skybox.
** DONE: Determined grid scale to layout future props for the landscape
** DONE: Imported asset piles into editor content list
** DONE: Tested of size and dynamics of each object in the game space.
** DONE: Analyzed the graphical and aesthetic quality of each obect using the in-game camera and the first person view camera to preview user experience
** DONE: Molded landscape to contain two floating islands using asteroid meshes, one with a campsite and the other with a hot air balloon.
** DONE: Sampled materials for home base island for proper aesthetic
** DONE: Installed rope bridge blueprint - tested gravity, width and scale settings, set end point to proper x-y-z coordinates
** DONE: Augmented lighting with two additional light sources - top down directional, for working only, not to be kept in final render
** DONE: Installed Earth, Moon, star assets and scaled, brightness altered

*BACK-END*
** DONE: Created a sibling system to the object outline system where hovering over an item marked by the outline within the interactable range would trigger a material change in the object
** DONE: Reworked live material changing system where an event would create a dynamic material in an object to fade in or out the object
** DONE: Mapped out motion controller button functionality



*THURSDAY 6/25*

*FRONT-END*
** DONE: Rebuilt everything on Wednesday due to file loss
** DONE: Opened materials in the graphics editor
** DONE: Painted textures over static meshes
** DONE: Mapped a graphical mesh of space onto skybox blueprint



*BACK-END*
** DONE: Created basic procedural static mesh blueprint to respond to cuts by directional planes
** DONE: Reworked how a player would pick up objects in the sandbox and increased the grab range
** DONE: Created a gun and bound launching a projectile from its forward vector to trigger projectile hit events


*FRIDAY 6/26*

*FRONT-END*
** DONE: Experimented with having the entire map emit low emission lighting
** DONE: changed light source to a point of light emitting a radius of light
** DONE: Installed picnic area and fireworks tent on campground
** DONE: Childed point of lights to lantern objects
** DONE: Set up forest assets with movement
** DONE: Changed lit perspective to player collisiion
** DONE: Installed drivable hot air ballon blueprint
** DONE: Used rope spline assets to tie down ballon (able to take damage)
** DONE: Scaled and Upgraded fire particle to emit glow

*BACK-END*
** DONE: Customized certain objects such as a gun or a sword to snap into the hand when picked up
** DONE: Playtested demo using a sword to cut through a variety of procedurally generated meshes
** DONE: Began work on a body attached inventory system whereby a player can strap objects to their VR body

*SATURDAY 6/27*

*FRONT-END*
** DONE: Uploaded map and map assests folder into zip file andd sent a link to Yuhao through dropbox / gmail

*BACK-END*
** DONE: NYELobbyExp optimization for VR
** DONE: NYELobbyExp version 2 packaged and ready for delivery Monday
