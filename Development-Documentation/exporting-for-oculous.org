Oculus Home: (has more restrictions than an actual .glb file)

Parameters for modeling:
1 cm in Blender = 1 m in Home
Model/package =< 10 mB (the limit)
Optimize triangulation (clean geometry)
No max polycount, but attempt to keep to a minimum (apparently performance can break with a 50k mesh)

Parameters for texturing:
Only one material per sub-mesh.
Combine submeshes where possible to reduce draw calls.

glTF format supports Metallic-Roughness PBR model:
Base Color
Metallic
Roughness
Normal
Ambient Occlusion
Emission

The format does expect the textures in a specific format.
Base Color, Normal, and Emission textures - saved as individual files, lossless format (i.e. png).
Ambient Occlusion, Roughness, and Metallic textures - saved in a single channel-packed texture to reduce the number of texture loads. The textures need to be packed into the channels of your texture as follows:

Red: Ambient Occlusion
Green: Roughness
Blue: Metallic

Parameters for animations:
1 animation per .glb

Steam VR:

General organization parameters: (Destination folder)
folder with all the files associated the model cannot use:
 upper case letters
spaces
symbols
only lower case letters, numbers and underscores

Directions for modeling:
 In the asset browser, click the model editor (person) and then file —> create new from mesh file

Directions for texturing:
importer will have created basic materials for each texture according the shader you selected upon import. If you don't remember doing that the default is VR_standard,
default the Vr Standard shader has no Specular. Turn it on with the checkbox.

Directions for animations:
Animations will be under the model’s directory
Model editor —> add animation
Able to add multiple, change frame count, timing, whether they loop when they loop, etc.
