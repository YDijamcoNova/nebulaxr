Define the Problem:
Nova XR New Year’s Eve Project is missing a FUN lobby experience.
Constraints + what that means

Must use 3D models available in NOVA XR visual library.
(avoids legal issues sourcing graphics from third party sources, saving time)
(avoids time burden of having to generate new 3D models)

We can only use interactive functionalities which are quick to implement.
(this rests on what yuhao is comfortable implementing in engine:
trigger functionality: user pushes button and some event is triggered as a result
picking up and moving objects)

Must be able to build a high quality prototype by July 20, 2020, 
(leaving two weeks for debugging. So project must be built to completion in 4 weeks)
(3D assets cannot be built from scratch unless they are simple and geometric)

Project file must stay as light as possible for transfer.
(this means we will keep the lobby scale as small as possible and be judicious about how we incorporate highly rendered graphics and functionalities)
(the simpler the project, the less opportunity for bugs. In engineering, the more moving parts, the more opportunity for something to break)

The talents of each member of the team must be considered and featured.
(mei music, yuni design, ibti research, marwa ideas, danny UI, yuhao engineering)

Tech Specifications
The lobby will be built in Unreal Engine 4 using 3D models owned by Nova XR Media and optimized for a variety of VR headsets including Oculus, etc.
Milestones
