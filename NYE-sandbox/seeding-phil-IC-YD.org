-Yuni believes that games are the next stage of evolution in entertainment, surpassing even film and television. Having witnessed the industry mature alongside herself over the last two decades or so, she feels an acutely personal connection to the medium. 
-At its highest potential, she believes the enjoyment and process of game design can illuminate the human condition and human nature in a way that no other form of media can.
