*If I have a premium account now which I pay for monthly, building the project now, what happens when I cancel my account?*

- If you cancel your account, your downloaded contents will be removed and you will not be able to access them again.
- So I would suggest to download everything that you think you might need before cancelling your account. 

*Do I lose the right to the content I created using these files in the past?*

- No you do not lose the right to the content but in order to still use the content after cancelling subscription, you can't use it for new works rather existing works
