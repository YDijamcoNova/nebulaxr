** UPDATE IN PROGRESS: TRANSFERRING NOTES 

** SONIC HAPTICS

*What are haptics?*

- interaction involving touch

** Sonic Mechanics: Audio as Gameplay
*http://gamestudies.org/1301/articles/oldenburg_sonic_mechanics*

- 1950: sound art and interactivity crossed paths with John Cage's 4'33''

*Types of Dynamic Audio*

- Interactive Audio: responds directly to players actions
- Static Audio: sounnd tracks 

*Ways to Make an Object Known*

- Continuous
- Momentarily
- Spontaeous
- Repetitive

*Strategies*

- Earcons: train player to recogize certain musical phrases
- Short sounds: to convey evocative scenes
- Echo: cavernous indoor areas
- Acousmatic sounds: an invisible sound source- to convey dark scenes

*Types of Sounds*

- Casual: listen for source of sound 
- Semantic: listen to understand speech 
- Reduced: listen to pitches, harmonies and rhythms

** Multimodal Interaction of Conntextual and Non-Contextual Sound and Haptics in Virtual Simulations

*High End Haptic Device Features*

- Realistic perception of pressure 
- Temperature
- Position
- Movement 
- Texture 
- Vibration 

*Higher Fidelity*

- Higher fidelity = higher price 
- Fidelity: how well does virtual reality emulate the real world 
- High end fidelity has been used prominently in medical environment 
- Used for higher mission critical uses 

*Lower Fidelity*

- Cost range: $250- 600 USD
- Rumble Packs: simple vibration feedback in devices 
- Remote controlled robotic tools
- Used for lower mission critical uses 

*Room for Improvement for Future VR Experience*

- Higher fidelity 
- improve in quality of rumble packs
- Automatic sensory robotic tools
- Maybe combine all uses into one product?
