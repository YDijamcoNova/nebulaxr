**	ADVANTAGES
***	real-world environments, well-researched/documented re: efficacy particular to the product, menu/features don't detract from immersion or interrupt landscape (would be worthwhile to consider how we could similarly implement our menus)
**	DISADVANTAGES
***	graphics blurry and dimensions can be awkward, mixed reviews, low engagement beyond customization, isn’t transparent on pricing, meditation experience requires access to an existing headset, spa experience incompatible with oculus go + quest
