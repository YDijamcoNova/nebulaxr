** elevation api, privacy policy allowing for conditional and credited use of data, billing unclear - cannot guarantee whether or not opting for this service would be ideal

** historical site virtual tours hosted by matterport, company with a focus on 3D capture and real estate 
** we can potentially boost engagement in our experience with more sophisticated UI vs tooltips scattered across the environment

** 360 pictures, scene options, like matterport a very fragmented experience of the park, though more naturalistic
