** Use CSS for all styling.

Figured out how to change fonts so we can have only one font used throughout the website.

*font-family: Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;*

/Input wherever needed/


Changed cursor to pointer for all over the page use.

*cursor: context-menu;*

/Input cursor in heading if and when the mouse hovers over text it does not become a cursor./


Figured out how to change color of "ABOUT" and "MORE CONTENT" when mouse hover over it.

*p:hover {color: red;}*

/Input in heading/
