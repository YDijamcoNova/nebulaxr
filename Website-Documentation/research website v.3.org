* Research Library

** Categorized Research (World-Building, Functionality, Dev & Design, Psychology, Marketing + Efficacy)
*** Brokedown categories further in subtitles - most have three subsections
*** Will be expanded on in Summary/Overview for simpler navigation + better clarity

** For each menu subsection, changed background images to mesh with theme
*** Adjusted image orientation to better frame it and accomodate text
*** Maintained visual + design fx 

** Wrote introductory blurb, impacted keyword density and made mention of keyword for SEO 
*** Included logo for branding purposes, color also meshes well with the site's color scheme

** Removed closing section of website due to complications with image insertion
*** Can revisit formatting in the future, but visual builder continously removes my progress 

** Inserted image with alt-text and included a closing blurb with internal links to products, services, and homepage (for current project updates)
*** Got SEO back up to 78 from 68
*** Backed up image + code on backup page to prevent losing any further progress

** Published page + shared with team for feedback

* Next Steps

** Continue working on increasing SEO
*** Can't necessarily include more media on the page (got SEO up to 80)
*** Will be writing up blurbs for each of the individual sections which will impact any issues with keyword density
*** Will be figuring out a natural way to link to an external site 
*** Will begin creating individual webpages for each of the subsections which the sections themselves will direct to when clicked on

** Will update Marwa on progress to establish other pages + improve SEO/formatting

** Will also work with Joe to recover old products page - menu has changed since adjusting it on Clone?

** Continue publishing new pages and updating team
*** will need to pick another format/page to Clone, must reevaluate design + content priorities
