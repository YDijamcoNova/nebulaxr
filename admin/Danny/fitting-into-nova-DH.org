-Regarding weaknesses, in the past I've had a tendency to get really caught up in my work. It has been the case where the solution is not obvious and I tend to keep going until the issue is resolved.
- However, I am learning to become aware of when I can become frustrated and counterproductive, and take a step back to come back to a problem with a fresh mindset or ask for the help of one of my peers.
