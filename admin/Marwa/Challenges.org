* Summarizing the challenge

** Ibti and I have created new webpages for the Nova website.
/But we encountered some problems./

** Problem 1 - We couldn't get the math rank up to or surpass 90.
*** We have been having trouble figuring out how to add a table contents.
*** Also, when we do something and save it, sometimes it deletes on its own.

** Problem 2 - The website as a whole is at a 76/100 on the SEO analysis. We need at least a 90.
*** I don't understand exactly what to do, but Joe and I are trying to figure it out.
