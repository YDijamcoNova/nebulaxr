*Work Session Thursday 6/25 10AM-12AM*


*COMPLETED*


** Did some sketching to decide layout for the game actors.
** Started day formatting project settings and importing all assets into it
** Built out initial aesthetic design including about 80% of valuable assets


*SETBACKS*


** MINOR setbacks: skybox not playing nice, floating asteroids with landscape materials? Got things to look beautiful despite setback.
** MAJOR setback occured at 5:30 PM after 6 hours of work. PC crashed while saving--project file corrupted, Unreal unable to read it. Designs lost!
** MAJOR setback 2: PC begins a continual reboot cycle when I try to launch Unreal.
** MAJOR setback 3: EPIC games erases my project files from the cloud without my authorization, INCLUDING the Declan Sample!


*NOTES*


** This started out as a minor issue with Unreal crashing while I was building the Declan sample on Monday. That issue was self-limiting...a nuisance, but didn't jeopardize my work flow.
** Spent the later half of the evening today attempting to diagnose the issue...tried uninstalling and reinstalling Unreal. Didn't solve the problem.
** Tried messing with project settings in Unreal following advice gathered from Unreal forums...no dice.
** Faulty PSU?
** BACK UP PROJECT FILES FROM NOW ON.

** Spoke with Yuhao briefly, couldn't diagnose. Yuhao is very busy building and testing a system for the game on his end. Will need my design within a couple days.


*OBJECTIVE*


** Resolve techincal issues within a DAY, another day of production CANNOT be lost to these issues.
** Will buy a replacement PC if I cannot fix this one.
** Contact EPIC Games with project erasure issue.
