** Looked over Joe's doc "web-design-aspect-ratio."

** Wrote NYELobbyExperience Summary:
** "With NYELobbyExperience, the Nebula XR Dev team tackles the design challenge of a fun lobby experience for 
** launching Nova XR's New Year's Eve Livestreams. With visuals inspired by Nova and Nebula's space motif, 
** integrating the notion of time and space travel, the setting of the lobby is a campsite on an asteroid! 
** As of week 2 of production, the game experience is structured as a mini-puzzle; Users must enable a hot air-balloon 
** for flight among the stars--using only items scavenged from the campgrounds. Win the game and drive the balloon into 
** one of many wormholes -- each launching a 360 video stream in a unique place on earth on New Year's Eve. 
** Dessert and champagne are complimentary!""
