-*** One simple sentence describing a personal ambition for the summer
-= To learn how to function as a team in a work setting and pick up as many new skills as I can. I like pushing my comfort zone and am willing to work with concepts unfamiliar to me.

-How would you describe the work culture of Nova? What do you like most about working there?
-How would you describe the work environment? Is it typically more independent or collaborative?
-WHat are the key characteristics you feel an intern should possess in order to be successful at Nova?

-* Without doing research, one sentence that expresses what you know about:
-
-** Teamship: I am unfamiliar. 
-** Emacs: I’ve recently become aware of its relation to .org mode, but have no knowledge beyond that.
-** Git: I’m aware of some of its use in regard to coding, but I have difficulty navigating and understanding it.
-** XR: I know this is VR related but I’m not sure about the specifics.
-** Linux: I am unfamiliar.
-** Windows: I’m generally aware of Windows, but I don’t use their products outside of Microsoft Suite.
-** Adobe After Effects: I have no personal experience with this software.
-** Adobe Premiere: I have no personal experience with this software.
-** Adobe Photoshop: I have no personal experience with this software.
-** Blender: I have no direct experience with this, but I have more recently become aware of its use in accessing and viewing assets.
-** Maya: I am unfamiliar.
-** C++: I know this is a coding language, but I have no experience with coding.
-** C sharp: I believe this is a variation of C++ making it another coding language with a somewhat different functionality.
-** CSS: I am unfamiliar.
-** Python: I am unfamiliar.
-** Java: I’m aware of Java in regard to flash, but nothing beyond that.
-** JS: I’m unclear what this is in reference to.
-** Webxr: I am unfamiliar.
-** Wordpress: I’ve previously hosted two websites on Wordpress.
-** Mobile apps: I have no technical knowledge in regard to mobile apps.
-** Gaming: I play games and participate in some gaming communities, but beyond that my knowledge is limited.
-** Sales: I worked at a retail flagship store, so I have customer service and sales experience.
-** Marketing: I have a background in research and sales, and worked directly with the promotion and presentation of merchandise so I have some relevant experience.
-** Management: I have no management experience, but I am somewhat familiar with working relative to different management styles.
-** Leadership: I’ve been a team leader in the past, but I much prefer working as a member to help delegate tasks and refine projects.
-** Integrity: For me, integrity concerns one’s ability to identify and adhere to their own moral principles.
-** Duty: Depending on the moral framework, duty can vary, but I’d say it is one’s duty to preserve themselves and others.
-** Ethics: I’ve taken a number of courses in philosophy and am familiar with theories on applied ethics.
-
-* Paragraph your strengths and weaknesses.
-
-** Seeing as my background is primarily in qualitative social science research and social theory, I would say one of my major strengths is in analysis. I am able to draw upon my experiences in numerous fields to devise creative and mindful solutions. Through legal, social, and philosophical frameworks, I’ve learned to assess situations more critically. My research experience has also strengthened my ability to synthesize and organize information. My weaknesses are in financial analysis and computer science. I have a basic understanding of technology, but no personal experience with coding or game design. Though I am familiar with quantitative research methods, I’m inexperienced in the fields of economics and business administration. 
-
-* One simple sentence describing a personal ambition for the summer
-
-** This summer, I would like to learn a skill outside my fields of expertise. 
-
-* Interview us. What are three questions you would like answered?
-
-** Will we be spending the summer working on developing a singular VR experience?
-** What is the day-to-day of developing a project after deciding on a concept?
-** For less intensive projects, how long does development typically take before anything is ready to test?
-
-
-Can be the same day.  Depends on the core objective.  I would say typically a 6 month project, you don't test the VR deployment until month 3.   But, you might view assets inside a headset... Is that testing?  Yes, but maybe not the real testing period

-Great work!  OK, make it smooth.  Focus on getting the initial entrance very pleasant.  This is critical.  First 7 seconds first impression, to a magnitude more.
-
-Focus strongly on making this initial scene calm and pleasant.... Maybe minimize stimulus., directional light to  feel guided.
-
-I think trying to re-create the real world is impossible.  One would even need to assume a godlike complex to attempt it.
- But remixing can be effective and fun.  The idea of technically pulling from Google terrain is very interesting and can certainly be monetized with a good strategy.
-The national parks have market potential - but the schtick would have to be someting more powerfull than "check out the vista".  Maybe you can make a scavenger hunt in VR that coincides to clues hidden in the real parks, which drives visitations because the people who played it in VR are trying to level up, or win something.
-
-I really had fun trying this out!   It got me inspired, you can definitely make soemthing really cool this summer.  Keep up the hustle -hell yeah!!

-
-One simple sentence describing what each of these words mean to you:
-
-
-PROVIDENT: always have the future in mind and far-sighted whenever there are new tasks at hand. This kind of mentality is cruical as we want constanly want to be prepared of what is to come. 
-
-SINCERE: one always needs to be sincere as this is a key way to build trust. If one is not sincere about the things they say, they would break a relationship and probably no one can talk the non sincere person seriously. 
-
-ANTICIPATORY: Always plan on anticipating failures, constant changes, successes- nothing in life is a straight road. 
-
-GRACIOUS: we should comfort, be sympathetic towards others and never be quick to judge.

-
-DILIGENT: Time is precious and if you aren't giving 100% to things, you basically have taken one step back in your professional and personal development.

-*** Paragraph your strengths and weaknesses.
-
-My greatest strengths are my technical abilities and enthusiasm in my work.I find it amazing to be be able to boot into some software with a blank screen and create something out of virtually nothing. It's the thought of endless possibilities within these softwares that motivates me to always improve upon what I have and seek greater understanding and utility of said softwares. Regarding my weaknesses, I often get ahead of myself with the scope of my work. When it comes to designing no matter the project or software, I tend to get very ambitious with what I want to accomplish just to realize that to do so would take me way past the deadline. However, because of it, I learned to really appreciate working on a team because it takes a group of people with a shared goal to have the courage to discuss what can and cannot be done within a realistic time table.
-
-*** One simple sentence describing a personal ambition for the summer
-
-To focus on more small scale scenes as to prioritize high visual fidelity and interactive systems.
-
-*** *Interview us.* What are three questions you would like answered?
-
-What struggles have you encountered as a company in the VR industry?
-
-Consistent financial support and centralization.  As the VR industry has been per project funded for us, it fragments the team but broadens the reach.  There has been struggles in finding the time to execute everything we plan, and agree to.  Not succeeding here significantly reduces output value...
-
-Funny stuff too, from people jumping through the mixed reality screen at your fancy hotel demo, to crazy landlord screaming drunk in your office a late Saturday, stranded (briefly) in the middle-east.
-
-What I like about nova most is that we pursue projects we wish to.  By having the passion to bring to life any creation is fulfilling and positive.   
-
-Start up struggles: Team optimization, capitalization, developing new workflows.  They are all more or less expected, and managable.
-
-
-*** What compelled you originally to go on this venture in VR?
-
-I played.  It was wild.  I was also on the hunt for something new and marketable.   XR was a decisive answer in 2016.  I quit my second job within a year.  I opened the LLC, sold a demo-serve to the French Trade Office, and built a team.   
-
-Opportunity to control my future - my time and values - maintaining independence and raising a family with education, opportunity, peace and creative pursuits.
-
-*** In what ways would you like to see VR technologies evolve on a hardware and software level as well as on a cultural level.
-
-Headset smaller. Hand tracking take over for controllers. Shared experiences - collaborative design.  Bring people to places they would not otherwise venture - simulated or imagined.  XR on the web.

-*BIO*
-
-** Yuni grew up all around the world raised in a variety of cultural ecosystems. She credits these early experiences for her unique world view and appreciation for different perspectives—the hallmark of her personality. 
-
-** Yuni spends much of her free time in the study and practice of creative endeavors.
-** She loves stories. Those dearest to her heart are titles in classical literature, especially British Literature. She can lie in bed for hours with a book and treasures the sensation of feeling absorbed into its pages. Sometimes, she writes science fiction or short stories.
-** She loves to dissect games and films with a critical eye, watching for cinematography and thematic symbolism. She has produced a handful of short student films and has a solid grasp of the pre-production, production, and post-production process in film.
-
-** Yuni is in her third year of studying the Fine Arts at The City College of New York. It is her first time studying art in a formal setting. Someday, she hopes to channel her skills, passion, education and unique perspective into a fruitful career as an art director.
-** For the Summer of 2020, Yuni hopes to be relied upon by NEBULA XR for creative vision, good ideas, and the generation of impressive art assets.
-
-** Outside of her career pursuits, Yuni cooks every day and renovates her condo endlessly. When she craves excitement, she spends an evening at the opera, engages strangers in deep conversation, or hops in her car and drives somewhere new. For special thrills, she hikes and kayaks.
-** Perhaps more than anything, Yuni loves spending quality time with family, friends and her beloved felines—Stela, Misa, Oli, and Uma, who keep her company at her work desk.

-{{{subtitle(Org Mode Basics)}}}
-{{{theme-color(4b7985)}}}
-
-
-** Yuni is both excited and perplexed by the emerging field of Virtual Reality and its prospects as a gaming and storytelling medium.
-** In the world of art, Yuni finds herself moved by the work of the old masters. A traditional artist herself, Yuni is a master of drawing and sculpture. She has been drawing since she was old enough to hold a pencil, and favors the style of realism.
-
-** Yuni sustains skillsets which she believes are growing increasingly rare in the age of technology. 
-
-** She has devoted years cultivating her mastery of art theory and principles—including composition, balance, emphasis, harmony, movement, pattern, proportion, repetition, rhythm, unity, and variety.
-** As an Electronic Design Major, she is studying to be a master of graphic design elements—such as unity, hierarchy, color, line, point, shape, texture, space, and form. She synthesizes these principles with intelligent concepts in her designs.
-
-** Sensing the need to join the digital era, she is now investing time learning to configure these skills inside software applications such as Adobe Creative Suite and game engines like Unreal Engine.

-*NEBULA XR*
-*The NOVA Intern Team has elected to name itself NEBULA XR.
-
-**The name runs tangent to the astronomical definition of what a NOVA is: "...a star showing a sudden large increase in brightness.." or "a star that suddenly increases its light output tremendously" as defined by Merriam-Webster.
-
-**A "NOVA" is an astronomical event which is typically recognized as the point when astronomers become aware of a particular star's existence. 
-**Symbolically, that can represent NOVA as a company that has "appeared" in the VR market by "shining brightly."
-
-**According to spacecenter.org, a "nebula" is "...an enormous cloud of dust and gas occupying the space between stars and acting as a nursery for new stars."
-**In other words, it is a collection of particles(skills, talents, ambitions) which are not yet fully-formed but, through pressure and momentum, might eventually turn into stars (successful professionals).
-**In these terms, the Nova XR's intern team can be understood to be works in progress with lots of potential.
-
-
-*OTHER REASONS WHY THE NAME WORKS*
-
-**Nebula XR is parented by Nova XR and both start with an N.
-**It sounds cool.

-*Yuni's Philosophy*
-
-**In her work, Yuni aspires to demonstrate her excellent taste, perfectionism, and natural affinity for the fine arts for which she is seeking formal training. 
-Yuni strives to embody authenticity and humanity above all else, and believes that artists cannot create exceptional work without being brave enough to offer their whole selves, flaws and all, for scrutinizing eyes--for better or for worse.
-Yuni believes that games are the next stage of evolution in entertainment, surpassing even film and television. Having witnessed the industry mature alongside herself over the last two decades or so, she feels an acutely personal connection to the medium. 
-At its highest potential, she believes the enjoyment and process of game design can illuminate the human condition and human nature in a way that no other form of media can.

-
-One simple sentence describing what each of these words mean to you:
-
-
-*PROVIDENT
-** To me being provident means being efficient with time and time management, especially in planning.
-
-*SINCERE
-** To me, to be sincere is to mean what you say, and not to say things that you don't mean. It is to not misrepresent onesself. It is a simple concept but difficult to implement in academic and professional circles, because these contexts demand large amounts of pretense.
-
-*ANTICIPATORY
-** To me being anticipatory is having the skill of figuring out what is needed of you before you are asked.
-
-*GRACIOUS
-** To me being gracious is to act with an air of courtesy and kindness, even when it is difficult.
-
-*AMBITIOUS
-** To be ambitious is to set high standards and expectations for onesself and one's ventures.
-
-*ATTENTIVE
-** To be attentive is to give one's full attention when it matters because it comes naturally to you, not because it is demanded.
-
-*CONSIDERATE
-** To be considerate is to have a demeanor which proactively seeks to make room for the needs of others who you care for.
-
-*LOYAL
-** To be loyal is to maintain fidelity to a person or group / company. To be sincere, it must be inspired by an intrinsic appreciation for that which one is being loyal to, and not coerced from fear or necessity. Loyalty is earned.
-
-*DETERMINED
-** Determination is a series of internal decisions which lead a person to perservere out of desire for a cherished goal.
-
-*DILIGENT
-** Diligence is the quality of exhibiting attentiveness and devotion to the quality of one's work.
-
-*INNOVATIVE
-** Innovation is a thinking pattern which seeks to disrupt the status quo for some kind of benefit.
-
-*CREATIVE
-** Someone who is creative is inclined to generate something where there before was nothing, or to assemble pieces of something into something new. It is most often associated with artistic fields but in reality can apply to any craft in any field.
-
-*RESOURCEFUL
-** Someone who is resourceful is good at using what they currently have at their disposal to solve problems or produce solutions to dilemmas.
